# General info
These automations are made possible thanks to the other EspHome devices I created ([esp-energy-monitor](https://github.com/zioCristia/esp-energy-monitor) and [esp-smart-water-heater](https://github.com/zioCristia/esp-smart-water-heater)) and the [DomyStyle](https://github.com/DomiStyle) guide [esphome-panasonic-ac](https://github.com/DomiStyle/esphome-panasonic-ac).
